# Java_Servlets

In this section exist my Simple Java Servlet projects. They have no CSS built on to them and are just a white canvas set to test servlet ability. Each one of them is a Netbeans project and you can run them by installing the latest Glassfish server and a MariaDB driver in the library section from Netbeans with no problem.
